This folder would typically contain the code for the microservice that the cosnumer team works on.
The consumer microservice connects to the gRPC service exposes by the producer microservice.

We simplify this demo by providing microservice-like applications with a user interface instead of having real microservices that we would have to build.

The sources of this application are available here https://github.com/wojciechbulaty/examples/tree/master/grpc-shop
